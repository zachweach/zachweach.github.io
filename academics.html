				<dt>CSCI0111: Computing Foundations: Data</dt>
				<dd><a href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci0111/">link to the course webpage</a></dd>
				<dd>for <time datetime="2021-09-08">fall 2021</time> and <time datetime="2022-01-22">spring 2022</time></dd>
				<dd>an introductory computer science course at brown. it teaches the basics of computer science and coding, including data structures (especially tabular data) and algorithms, with a focus on applications in data science. it is primarily taught in python and <a href="https://www.pyret.org/">pyret</a>, a language developed for computer science education.</dd>
				<dd>in this position, i held weekly 1-on-1 office hours to assist students with the conceptual content of the course and debugging. i provided the same help asynchronously via a course-wide discussion board. additionally, i held weekly "lab sections", where students would apply the skills they have learned and write code in a low-pressure learning environment.</dd>
				<dd>in fall 2020, i served on the "projects team", where I was responsible for creating and maintaining project handouts, solution code (written in pyret), resources/assets, and stencil code for students.</dd>
				<dt>CLPS0900: Statistical Methods</dt>
				<dd>this course provides an introduction to statistical methods, inference, and analysis, with a specific focus on those relevant to life and psychological sciences. additionally, basic coding in R is taught.</dd>
				<dd>i held weekly 1-on-1 and group office hours to assist students with the content of the course. additionally, i created solution code (written in R) and rubrics for homework assignments.</dd>
