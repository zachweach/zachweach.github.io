		<h2>this, for starters, is a project, i guess.</h2>
		<p>i've decided to separate my projects into slightly more managable categories. they're mostly broken down by where/how i completed them. since many of these are school projects, i can't share the source code publicly, but if you're interested, please contact me and we can talk about specifics of what i've done!</p>

			<h4>um... this</h4>
			<p>this webpage is a project! it's not the most flashy, but that's intentional; i don't really like the overwhelming style of many other protfolio sites. my focus, instead is on accessibility, which i hope is evident.</p>
			<details>
				<summary>design & implementation</summary>
				<p>this site originates from the capstone course i completed as part of the "web design for all" specialization. as such, accessibility has been a priority from the start (as it should always be).</p>
				<p>of course, i want you to be able to check out all that i've done, so i hope that you've enjoyed your time here so far!</p>
				<p>the <a href="https://github.com/zachweach/zachweach.github.io.git">source code of this page</a> is available on my github, so i hope you'll check it and validate (pun intended) my claims!</p>
