		<h2>this, for starters, is a project, i guess.</h2>
		<p>i've decided to separate my projects into slightly more managable categories. they're mostly broken down by where/how i completed them. since many of these are school projects, i can't share the source code publicly, but if you're interested, please contact me and we can talk about specifics of what i've done!</p>

		<h3>computer systems</h3>
		<p>these projects were completed in my computer systems course at brown. nothing too "flashy" here, but these projects are more technical in nature anyway.</p>

			<h4>atoi</h4>
			<p>written in x86_64 assemply, this project implements the built-in C function <code>atoi()</code>, which converts a string argument to an integer.</p>
			<details>
				<summary>design & implementation</summary>
				<p><code>atoi()</code> goes through each ascii character in the input and loops through each one until it either reaches the end or finds a non-numerical character.</p>
				<p>one of the biggest challenges of this project was that it had to be written entirely in machine code and not some other higher-level langauge, so i had to manage registers and accumulators in the system processor.</p>
				<p>honestly, this project was not very long, but gave me a really good understanding of how registers and low-level processing work.</p>
